# Dixie Korley 

Hello,

Hello there! I'm Dixie, currently working in a help desk technician role and aspiring to transition into data analysis. I am working on getting my CompTIA Data+ certification. 

Here, I share my journey, experiences, and projects related to data analysis. I believe in continuous learning, problem solving, improvement and constantly seek opportunities to enhance my skills. If you have any insights, advice, or potential collaborations related to data analysis, I'd love to connect.
